## üìå Project Overview

This project involved the design and implementation of a drive circuit for a hybrid two-phase stepper motor (type 42BYGH801). The motor was controlled in both open-loop and closed-loop configurations, achieving speeds up to 150 RPM. We applied control strategies including:
- Open-loop PWM signal generation for H-bridge driving
- Closed-loop current control using a PI corrector for stable operation at various speeds

## üöÄ How to Use

1. Set desired speed via DC voltage input.
2. The system generates PWM signals for the H-bridge according to voltage-to-frequency output.
3. The motor spins with speed proportional to the input voltage.
4. In closed-loop mode, the PI controller ensures current tracks the reference accurately.
